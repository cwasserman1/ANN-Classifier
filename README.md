# ANN-Classifier
This is a working multi layer Artificial Neural Network Class that works for classification purposes from scratch. It uses backpropagation and Stochastic gradient Descent to train. It works with a ~85% accuracy rate on the MNIST dataset. I am going to add more functionality to it including the ability to use different hidden layer activation functions and different loss function. I would also like to add the ability to create convolutional layers.
